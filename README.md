LORIS (Longitudinal Online Research and Imaging System) is a self-hosted web application that provides data- and project-management for neuroimaging research. LORIS makes it easy to manage large datasets including behavioural, clinical, neuroimaging and genetic data acquired over time or at different sites.

This Readme covers installation of **LORIS@UVA** using **Docker**.

Please consult the [Loris documentation](https://github.com/aces/Loris) for more information. Other installation instructions and more LORIS documentation for developers can also be found on the [LORIS ReadTheDocs website](https://acesloris.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Installation

### System Requirements

* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/)
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Installing some dependencies may require `sudo` privileges. Other dependencies are defined through Dockerfiles. Consult the [Loris repository](https://github.com/aces/Loris) for more information on these requirements.

### Install Steps

1. Create environment files for the MySQL (*mysql.env*) and CouchDB (*couchdb.env*) containers in the project repo

    mysql.env example

    ```env
    MYSQL_DATABASE: $loris_db_name
    MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: $db_root_password
    ```

    *$loris_db_name â‡¾ "loris" or one-word project name*

    couchdb.env example

    ```env
    COUCHDB_USER: $dqt_user
    COUCHDB_PASSWORD: $couch_root_password
    ```

    > :warning: **Warning:** Keep these passwords secret! Do not check the *.env* files into your repo!

2. Run `docker compose up -d` in the root folder of the repository

    > :memo: **Note:** If you make any changes to the *Dockerfile* or *docker-compose.yaml*, you will need to rebuild the images using `docker compose build` before running `docker compose up`

3. Open your browser and go to: `<loris-url>/installdb.php`. This web page will prompt you for your mysql connection information. Follow the instructions to finalize LORIS installation, then restart Apache in the *loris-web-1* Docker container (name could vary) using `sudo service apache2 reload`.

    > :memo: **Note:** `<loris-url>` is most likely `localhost`

4. Follow the [Setup Guide in the LORIS Wiki](https://github.com/aces/Loris/wiki/Setup) to complete your post-installation setup and configuration, and for more documentation.
